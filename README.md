A cybersecurity and cloud security engineer at heart, passionate about building hands-on systems, lab environments, and open-source tools 🖥️🔒🚀

I’m a lifelong learner who loves exploring virtualization, IAM, and distributed systems.
I love breaking things, figuring out how they work, and documenting the process so others can learn too. My projects reflect curiosity, precision, and a drive to make technology more accessible and understandable.
